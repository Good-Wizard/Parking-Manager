#### The application provides a web interface for managing parking spaces, allowing users to park their vehicles, track their entry and exit times, and view historical parking data. It utilizes SQLite databases to store current parking information and historical records.

# Key Features
## Database Management:
### Two SQLite databases are used:
database.db for current parking records and history.db for historical data.
The application automatically creates necessary tables if they do not exist, ensuring data integrity.
## Logging:
The application implements a logging system using RotatingFileHandler to capture error messages. Logs are stored in a logs directory, helping in debugging and monitoring application performance.
## Routes:
### Home Route (/home): 
Displays the current status of parked cars, including the number of occupied and free parking spaces.
### Park Car Route (/park): 
Accepts a POST request to register a new car's entry into the parking system, capturing the plate number and entry time.
### Exit Car Route (/exit/<int:car_id>): 
Handles the exit of a car, calculating the duration of parking and the associated cost based on predefined rules. It updates both the current parking and historical records.
### History Route (/history): Displays a list of all parking history records, allowing users to review past parking activities.
## Error Handling:
The application includes robust error handling, logging errors that occur during database connections, data retrieval, and other operations. User-friendly error messages are displayed in the web interface when issues arise.
## Cost Calculation:
The application implements a tiered cost structure based on the duration of parking, providing a clear pricing model for users.
Technical Details
## Framework:
Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
## Database: 
SQLite, a self-contained, serverless SQL database engine.
## Logging: 
Configured to log errors to a file with a maximum size of 10 KB, retaining up to 10 backup logs.
## Date and Time Management: 
Utilizes Python's datetime module to handle timestamps for parking entries and exits.
# User Interface
The application renders HTML templates using Flask's render_template function, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the parking system. Users can easily navigate between parking, exiting, and viewing history.

# Conclusion
This Flask application serves as a comprehensive solution for managing parking operations, combining database management, error logging, and user interaction in a cohesive manner. It is suitable for small to medium-sized parking facilities looking to streamline their operations and enhance user experience.
